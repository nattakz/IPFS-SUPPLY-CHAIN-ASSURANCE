# IPFS Supply Chain Assurance

IPFS based protocol for assurance the supply chain process.

This project allows sharing photos of good's deliveries in a safe mode. When the supplier delivers the goods to the carrier, they take a photo of it in order to show that it corresponds to what was requested by the customer. And most importantly, that the goods are in good condition. The photo is uploaded to IPFS. Afterward, the carrier signs the CID, and the hash generated by this proccess is uploaded to the blockchain (with the corresponding CID and carrier's public address). 
The CID of the photo is sent to the customer.
If there were to be any problem with the state of the goods received by the customer, and the photo received corresponds to the defective merchandise, the customer may verify if the CID is the original, entering it into the system, and requesting the carrier to sign said CID. If the obtained hash differs from the one stored in the smart contract, the system will issue the message indicating that the CID is fake.

In order to access to the system, users must identify themselves with their metamask wallet. Depending on their role (medical company, doctor or patient), they access to diferent screens.

1. The medical company (the owner's site) register doctors in the system.

```bash
npm start
```

6. Setting the different accounts (medical company, doctor and patient) as current connected account in the metamask wallet, you will see the different screens mentioned above.
Connect to the system with doctor's account, and upload the image: assets/example.png
